# Capstone---Slow-Drip-DDoS-Attack-

### Slow Drip DDOS Attack
This study will focus on the one of the latest emerged DDoS attack known as Slow Drip Attack. Slow drip
attacks work by attacking prefixes (e.g. wy546t5r) to well known domains (such as google.com), ultimately forming domains that
do not exist (wy546t5r.google.com). These DNS requests overload authoritative DNS servers leading to a denial of service

### GOAL
Goal is to develop a detection mechanisms for detecting slow drip attacks based solely on a single domain. Used already identified clusters to validate existence of different families
